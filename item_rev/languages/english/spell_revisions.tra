@1308 = ~Durin d'Artham, one of the most devoted paladins of Lathander, lay on his deathbed after decades of service to his god, and decided that he had not done enough to serve his god. Summoning the most accomplished spellcasters available, he begged them to bind his soul into a mighty pair of bracers for centuries to come, granting his strength and skill to those devoted to their deity. The spell worked, and Durin still serves warriors of the purest heart.

The willing sacrifice of a vast fortune in gold, combined with the holy venerations of the sanctifying ceremony, have convinced the blessed powers to transform these already formidable gauntlets into gloves of awesome righteous power.

@1723 = ~When this odd horn is blown no sound issues forth, making most people discard it as useless. However, if the proper command word is known, the horn is capable of silencing all within its area of effect, providing that they fail a saving throw versus breath weapons. This horn may be used three times a day. The most common use of the Horn of Silence is as a weapon against mages. Fighters often employ the horn, silencing enemy mages and drastically improving their own chances of success against the frail magic users.

@2162 = ~This single-handed weapon is infused with the very essence of virtue, and is rumored to be the sanctified blade of the famous paladin Sir Wediyer. The weapon was lost when Sir Wediyer pursued a fleeing pit fiend through a planar rift. Neither the fiend nor Sir Wediyer ever returned.
