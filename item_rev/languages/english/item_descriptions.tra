Unfortunately, multiple protective enchantments of these kind don't stack, and thus no other amulet, cloak, or ring of protection can be worn while wearing this amulet.

Known for its ability to enhance spellcasting, the Amulet of Metaspell Influence is highly sought after by practitioners of magic. It was created by Elairdrin Mellwith who resided in the Star Mountains. His reasons for fabricating such an item stemmed from his womanizing habits, and to this end the Amplifier served his purpose well. It was later taken from him by a wizardress with a more destructive intent, but records detailing the change of hands vary widely.

@1009 = ~Creatures that attack the mind are the stuff of nightmares, so it is not surprising that items protecting against them might acquire some of their disrepute. Greenstone amulets, for example, have been linked to a claim that when the drow first retreated underground they fed on intellect devourers, and that eating such a creature without wearing a greenstone amulet produced a mind flayer. This is all, of course, nothing more than superstitious tavern talk. Nonetheless these mind shielding amulets are indeed used by drows who have to deal with the illithids, as they call them, being it a peaceful deal, or a not so peaceful one.

Years later she returned, a haunted look in her eyes. Around her neck she wore an amulet that glowed with power - only the first of the artifacts she claimed to have learned how to create. She spoke long and passionately of how they could make use of such items - to not only bring peace to Rashemen, but break the back of Thay. The hathrans narrowed their eyes behind their masks as she spoke, fearing the young woman's intensity: but they listened, and gravely made her one of them.

Before long, the witches began to regret their decision. The young woman seemed obsessed with the idea of creating more items of greater and more sinister properties... and her plans grew more and more elaborate, from freeing the slaves of Thay to enslaving the Red Wizards in their place, sapping them of their power for her own devices. It was suspected that Arduelth had become a durthan, eternal enemy of the hathrans - but another witch saw once that she communed with something far darker. Though the young woman still dreamed of peace and freedom for her people, she had given herself over to a dark entity - her pure intentions savaged by the lengths she would dare go to achieve them.

Though it seems Arduelth's life has come to an end, the amulet still glows with a same promising light...

Warriors of these clans rely on agility and quick movements instead of pure strength and they get across the battlefield like a whirlwind. Barbarian shamans would sometimes create spells that would temporarily imbue the warriors with inhuman quickness and fleetness of foot. However, since these spells were temporary, often times the spell would wear off at inopportune times.

Thus a group of barbarian shamans once congregated to find a way to better harness the swift agility of the cheetah. For nearly a year the shamans remained out of sight from their home clans, busily focusing their attentions towards the magic to create such items. Then one day, the shamans returned to their respective clans, each holding a small necklace, with a pendant that resembled a cheetah's paw. The shamans gave this pendant to their strongest warrior of each clan. Once placed around the neck of the warrior, the speed of the cheetah filled their powerful bodies. From then on, the Amulet of Cheetah Speed, as it became known, would become one of the most prized artifacts within barbarian clans. Only the mightiest warriors wore the amulet, and it became the goal of all young warriors to one day be adorned with an amulet such as this.

The phantom watchdog immediately commenced a loud barking, revealing her presence to the Night King himself. When he was finished with her, he took the amulet, and since it had qualities useful for many adventurers, he made copies of it, which he sold throughout the land.

Although rumor has it that it was the dwarf's stench which overcame the mage, it was, in fact, his enchanted axe that dispelled the elf's magical defenses. It is obvious from the poor workmanship that Bala himself crafted the axe. The mystery lies in where its power originates, especially considering a detect magic spell reveals the axe has no magical properties. After a lengthy career of mage slaying, Bala died, never having revealed his secret to those who were willing to risk a lice infestation by approaching him. Some say that the axe was powered by Bala's intense hatred of wizards.

@1078 = ~Lonesome Road
This was the weapon of a cursed soul, doomed to wander the length and breadth of Faerûn for his crimes against the elves of Myth Drannor. Denell Harband was a human involved with the creation of the "Halfaxe Trail." Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks. When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders. The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerûn to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien. It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads.

This was the weapon of a cursed soul, doomed to wander the length and breadth of Faerûn for his crimes against the elves of Myth Drannor. Denell Harband was a human involved with the creation of the "Halfaxe Trail." Under the orders of his commander, Halvan the Dark, he forged ahead through elven forests despite protests and repeated attacks. When he was finally captured by the elves, he stated emphatically that he was free of guilt because he was just following his orders. The elven council deemed that Denell be placed under a High Geas to carry his axe from the Sword Coast of Faerûn to its borders in the east, and from the Great Glacier to Lurien. It took Denell thirty years to complete his task. When he finished, he was an accomplished warrior, weathered and beaten by years on foreign roads. On his way back to his home, he passed by Harrowdale and saw a wooden statue of Halvan the Dark raised proudly in a small town square. With a single-handed blow, he lodged his huge axe into Halvan's forehead. Never breaking stride, he decided to extend his never ending journey indefinitely, and he was last seen disappearing in the deepest caverns beneath the Marching Mountains.

Enhanced by the magic of the Baalor's Claw, the Axe of the Unyielding is now a most fearsome weapon - a vorpal-edged axe capable of severing an opponents head with a single blow.

The famous barbarian explorer Graena was a member of the Sky Pony tribe of the Uthgardt northerners. When she tried to leave the tribe to seek her fortune in southern lands, the elders of the tribe told her she could not leave. At that time, only men were allowed to leave the tribe. The elders believed women were too valuable to let go. In order to prove herself to the elders, Graena had to run a gauntlet of the strongest warriors in the tribe and wrest the belt of the head warrior from his body. Graena underwent the challenge and emerged bloody and broken, but victorious. According to tribal law, she was now the head warrior of the tribe and effectively male. The elders knew she was going to leave, but they gave her a warrior's name, Graena Blood-Has-Dried. She left the tribe, relinquished her position to the old head warrior, and returned his belt to him. But before she left, she swore to never harm a member of the tribe if she encountered one in the future.

Years later, she looked back on that fateful day and felt pride in the fact that she had beaten the greatest men of her tribe. She had a girdle constructed that looked identical to the one she had won. Not content to stop there, she had a priest of Tempus bless it with a powerful enchantment. Graena was wearing her belt when she died fighting a group of fire giants near the Marching Mountains.

As habitats receded, those who remained were invaded by displaced hordes of creatures, the more impatient of which marched on unspoiled land, taking whatever they wished. This particular weapon is said to have come from a dryad's tree, a final gift to nature's cause from a woodland spirit that could not hold back the invaders of her land. Hers was a bittersweet pain, as her wood might not have suffered so if it had not been so strong and lush. Less respecting scholars have since bestowed upon the item its ironic name, though the humor is not appreciated among nature's more devout followers.

This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any undead creature hit by it not only feels the sting of the weapon, but also has a chance of being blasted from existence.

Lord de'Arnise was likely concerned about the powerful magic that the weapon radiates when assembled, and rightfully so. A trail of destruction has followed it through history, leading straight back to the original owners. The flail was the creation of the warlike Rakshasa, a race of vengeful spirits that crave human meat, and used as an adaptable weapon that could suit any battle. During a particularly violent hunt the flail was lost, only to be returned when they used their affinity with magic to locate its powerful aura. They discovered that the weapon had found its way into the hands of a great human warrior, and the battle that followed was truly splendid. They have since used the item as bait countless times, 'losing' it again and again. Powerful items gravitate towards powerful people, and powerful people yield the most glorious battles.

This heavy mace was created for a very specific purpose: to slay undead. Any undead creature hit by it not only feels the sting of the weapon, but also has a chance of being blasted from existence. There are legends that speak of a priest so holy that a single glancing touch could send a vampire to oblivion, but whether the weapon empowered her or she empowered it is a topic for theologians.

Completely immune to any and all weapons used against him, Nysrogh rampaged throughout Amn, and Unileth took it upon herself to end the threat she had unleashed. Using her knowledge of the demon's weaknesses, she constructed a great club to defeat Nysrogh, and gave it to a brave but anonymous knight to be her champion.

Unileth's champion issued a challenge to Nysrogh, which the demon readily accepted, confident it could not be harmed by any weaponry known to the Realms. On the field of battle they met and beneath the fierce gaze of Nysrogh, Unileth's champion promptly dropped his weapon and fled in terror.

Nysrogh reached out to claim the champion's discarded club as a symbol of his victory. But as the demon's clawed hand touched the surface of the club he was encircled by a spell of imprisonment, for which he was completely unprepared. Unileth's ploy had worked, and the demon that could not be harmed by any weapon was forever trapped inside the magic club.

These boots were the source of his ability, though it is also believed that he formed an elite guild wherein each member was equipped identically, thus explaining why he was not just fast, but could seemingly appear in several places at once.

Others simply point out that the boots are useful for any plane-traveling adventurer.

Driven by years of rivalry, the Dukes of Spandeliyon and Delthuntle decided to organize a private contest that would proclaim the better archer between them. Both boasted the power of their magical bows, but that wasn't enough for Edwall Dest, Duke of Spandeliyon. He arranged for the theft of his opponent's bow, and on the day of the contest he couldn't help gloating about his advantage. The Duke of Delthuntle, known only as Raymond, demanded a demonstration of Edwall's skill on a scarecrow that he had placed. Edwall Dest drew his longbow and released the arrow with determination, not stopping to think how uncannily the target resembled himself. The missile split the large voodoo doll's head in twain, and at that moment Edwall's head did much the same.

In order to protect their community from an encroaching orc logging encampment, the hero Hannable the White was given this magnificent bow by the dryads of Gulthmere Forest. A deadly confrontation followed when the loggers dared try to cut down a great oak tree, nearly killing the dryad linked to it. With the help of powerful forest animals, Hannable slew entire bands of orcs before any more damage was inflicted upon the wood. The orcs were forced to abandon their plans, lest they suffer the continued wrath of Hannable and the forest. Needless to say, the hero who aided the grateful dryads lived happily... nay, VERY happily ever after!

Highly sought after among novice warriors, these items were once the property of the royal family of Threskel. Imparting a portion of the prince's legendary skill, these gauntlets grant the bearer mastery over all forms of melee weapons. The majority of their many previous owners seem to have come to bloody ends though; the gloves grant the ability of experience, but not the wisdom.

She also cast a permanent illusion over him so that his men would think he still wore his heavy chain. Tapid died twenty years later, his hands wrapped around the neck of an orc chief when old age took him.

@1314 = ~Bands of the Master
When the last kensai of Kamjin-Doh, the Master of Razors, was slain in the fields of western Kara-Tur, these simple leather bands were ripped from his arms... and his arms ripped from his shoulders... as punishment for his destruction of the Kamjin-Doh. The identities of those who defeated him are not known, but the rumors in Kara Tur were that his slayers were the spirits of three sword saints of Kamjin-Doh, returned from death to end the crimes of the renegade kensai.

In the surviving teachings of the Kamjin-Doh of Kara-Tur, it is written that a true weapon master relies not on leather, chain, or plate, but on honing their skills so that they are never struck at all... and this means a weapon master must know their enemy's movements like the movements of their own hand. But such mastery lies in staying focused upon your enemy even in the heat of battle... and these simple leather armbands are intended to do just that. While worn, they exert a slight calming influence on the mind of the sword saint that wields them, heightening the warrior's perceptions and senses, and allowing them to read the movements of their opponents easier. On the rare occasion when an enemy strikes a sword saint, these bands allow the wielder to shrug off pain (which in the teachings of Kamjin-Doh are called "distractions") and keep the pain where it belongs - on one's opponent.

If you wear these bands, never forget their purpose, never forget your focus, and never forget the reach of your enemy. Keep these three things in your heart, and they will serve you well in battle.

He was so annoyed by the inability of his crew to constantly maintain a perfect temperature around him that he hunted down a Stormlord of Talos and slew him for his cloak.

Though Balhoderie had some of his lady friends sew over the Talosian symbols on the cloak with bits of pirate flags, the brothers of the Stormlord never forgot Balhoderie's blasphemous plunder. By 1360, they had managed to install a youthful Stormlord on one of Balhoderie's three ships, the Sarketa. When the opportunity presented itself, the Stormlord roused the crew to mutiny. After Balhoderie had been overthrown, the Stormlord retrieves the cloak and installed himself as the new commander of the dead pirate's fleet.

Montolio was a good friend and a mentor of the dark elf Drizzt Do'Urden. He became blinded five years before he met Drizzt while serving with a ranger group known as the Range Watchers, when they encountered and came into battle against a vicious red dragon, which killed three rangers and melted Montolio's face. His face was healed by clerics, but his eyes were beyond repair. Being pitied even by the Range Watchers and thinking his life meaningless, he fell into despair and came to the grove later known as Mooshie's Grove to die there. Instead, he learned to survive by using his other senses to their fullest extent. He befriended the animals and made it a personal goal to keep watch on, and protect the caravans going near the grove from Graul, an orc leader, and his raiding band. Mooshie eventually died of natural causes in his sleep.

Blades such as this are often gifts to capable assassins in the service of Lolth, which typically use the weapon to seal a target in a cocoon of silk, stepping away from their thrashing foes to complete the murder with a poisoned dart or wrist-crossbow bolt. How it has made its way to you is anyone's guess.

Drowcraft weapons will dissolve to dust if exposed to sunlight and shouldn't be removed from the Underdark.

Suryris met his superior only once, in a battle that lasted hours and had the minotaur often fearing defeat. The contest ended when his opponent's sword broke, but Suryris knew he likely would have been bested had it continued. He presented his weapon to the astonished man, who thereafter told of this noble creature to anyone who would listen.

Attracting followers with promises of conquest, he sought to secure his authority by enchanting this symbolic weapon for his bodyguard, Jaramor Bold. When the Dragon's Breath strikes an opponent, it releases the harsh flames of a red dragon, the poisonous vapor of the green dragon, the blue dragon's lightning bolt, a spray of a black dragon's acid, and the white dragon's penetrating cold. Unfortunately, Ullion was the first to feel its effects, slain by the ambitious Jaramor, who sought to rule.

Named for its original owner, Sir Tain the Valiant, this helm saw many great battles in his possession. It was eventually passed on to Sir Tain's squire, who had served him faithfully for almost ten years. Alas, the young man had neither the strength nor the skill to uphold his master's legacy. It is rumored he lost his life in the pursuit of a worthy but ultimately futile cause, and the helm has had many owners since.

@1577 = ~Gift of Peace
Prized for its noble origin as much as for its benefits to the wearer, the first of these helms was originally intended to be a simple gift. There was no great crisis at hand, nor dangerous evil to be overthrown; just a wish for a friend to give a gift to another. It could just as easily have been a good book or a bottle of wine, but adventurers are eminently more practical in their gift giving. Subsequently, because of its effectiveness in any situation, countless variants of this helm were created. These helms have seen many great battles since theirs creation, but the simple virtue at theirs core is what has always been remembered.

Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well-spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

The fabled helm of Balduran has long been rumored to wield powerful protective magic. The exact nature of this magic, however, has not yet been determined.

The jewels allow the wearer to cast a variety of powerful spells and can absorb significant amounts of fire damage.

The few such helms reported to still exist have been traced back to a great cleric of Lathander from Baldur's Gate named Ergelion. Ergelion equipped his companions with these helms to turn back a horde of undead swarming out of the Troll Hills to the north. Though the horde never reached Baldur's Gate, none of that band of adventurers was seen or heard from again.

Raroh taught everything he knew about the art of killing and the secrets to create the most lethal of poisons to Avlorm, the most promising novice assassin within his own guild. But when Avlorm's power eventually threatened his own, Raroh had to teach his pupil the last lesson of his life. Avlorm and a few trained assassins planned to kill their master within his own house, with the aid of the night and the best poison they could brew. Unfortunately for them, Raroh was well aware of this, and thanks to this suit's immunity to venom, their poisoned darts and blades couldn't harm him. Subsequentely he easily dispatched all of them entwisting them in a poisonous cloud of ghastly, green vapors, and landing the killing blows with bare hands.

Lighter and less encumbrant than most hide armors, shadow dragonhide armor also protects the wearer from negative energy attacks. Suits such as this are much sought after, but few smiths are willing to craft them. The necessary materials are rare and dangerous to acquire, and dragons have long memories where their kin are concerned. Most smiths would prefer not to even risk association with the trade in dragon hide.

It is considered too cumbersome for use in advanced human cultures, but is common among more barbaric humanoids. It offers better protection than normal leather, but can be hard to maintain, often resulting in an offensive odor or shoddy appearance that prevents effective use.~
@1672 = ~This heavy and thick bear hide is all that remains of the fabled Aeger. Several hundred years ago the Aeger, a giant bear, terrorized hundreds of small villages up and down the Sword Coast. The bear was possessed by a seemingly unstoppable fury and it was invulnerable to fire, cold, electricity and acid. Finally the young men and women of several villages banded together, forming a militia almost two hundred people strong. The Aeger was surrounded and finally slain. Less than a dozen villagers survived, and they carved the Aeger's hide amongst themselves. Out of one of the pieces this armor was created.

The avatar of Talos watched Pellon start a fight with over twenty men in a bar one night. As a gift for such destructive entertainment, Talos touched the instrument that was laying next to Pellon's unconscious body. After that night, Pellon discovered that he could make men go berserk just by playing his harp. He took great delight in setting mercenaries and sailors against each other for several weeks. Eventually, Pellon Kay was laid low by a grim-featured warrior with a crossbow who didn't let Pellon get close enough to employ his magical instrument.

As he played, he focussed his attention first on the king. As the song played on, the spell of holding upon the king dissipated, and the noble liege slowly crept away. One by one Methild freed his patrons, being careful to keep the witches attention drawn his way. Finally, once all the family was free, the bard could play no longer and the witches saw his treachery. Poor Methild, unlike his liege, did not escape and was served on the supper table in their place.

Orin quickly agreed to the deal, figuring his problems were forever solved.

Of course the merchant quickly established himself as a cruel and insufferable tyrant, and within a month Orin's subjects had deposed their new ruler, dragged Orin from his beloved forest and imprisoned him in his own castle, forcing him to be their lord once more.

@1761 = ~Unholy Reaver +5~ //This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance and is only usable by anti-paladins.
@1762 = ~The two-handed sword is a derivative of the long sword. Weaponsmiths have always looked for ways to improve existing weapons. In an effort to improve the long sword, the blade was lengthened. Eventually, the handle had to be extended and two hands became necessary to properly swing the sword. The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.~
@1763 = ~Ir'revrykal
This dark, two-handed sword radiates evil from a distance. The weapon is not just unholy, but unearthly as well. Long thought to be just a myth, the blade's infamy pervades the accounts of learned bards and ancient sages. According to these accounts, the githyanki wizard-smith Ir'mlar forged the blade many centuries ago in dark caverns deep beneath Tu'narath. This githyanki city floats in the Astral Plane upon the petrified corpse of a dead god know only as "the One in the Void." To craft the sword, Ir'mlar allegedly used the One's own bones, which consist of a metallic substance unknown on the Prime Material Plane. The smith then imbued the weapon with a fiendish entity whom some seers claim was a mighty prince of the lower plane of Carceri. Others claim the sword contains the One in the Void's own spirit, banished within the blade for crimes committed against other gods in past ages. In any case, Ir'revrykal possess such an enmity against good that only blackguards committed to evil may wield it. Circular runes etched on the blade proclaim its name in ancient tir'su, the githyanki language. The runes translate roughly as "Pain-Servant."

When dual-wielding these two blades, Haer'Dalis surely is a dangerous opponent.

@1835 = ~Radiant Plate +2~ // The Practical Defense +3: The travelling adventurer could ask for no better a suit of armor in all the land. Specially commissioned by Bolhur 'Thunderaxe' at GREAT expense, this suit was his most prized, even if not his most ornate. Eminently practical, Bolhur demanded armor that would offer superior protection while hampering him in the least. By "hampering" he did not just mean in movement or weight: his ideal suit should be able to withstand the rigors of his wanderings with little maintenance. This is not to say that Bolhur 'Thunderaxe' neglected his armors - to say as such would get your ears boxed - but the regime of spit and polish required for a "gentleman's" suit was beyond his caring. Save the tassels and gilding of full plate for kings and heads of state: a working dwarf cares more of utility than looks.
@1836 = ~This brilliant golden armor has a short history. A priestess of Lathander named Iraeni of Suzail had it constructed for the champion of her church, a warrior-priest named Beldan Miller. Beldan employed the armor frequently, as Iraeni was often attacked by agents of Myrkul. After twenty years of serving Lathander, Iraeni decided to step down from her office, as did Beldan. They were married shortly after. Beldan gave the armor to an errant paladin of Lathander, who is believed to have died fighting a powerful undead creature in Amn.

Mobility is not very easy in this type of armor and as such dexterity while wearing full plates is highly restricted but they are to be worn by heavy infantry, and movement is not a priority. However, this magical specimen is made of mithral, a very rare, silvery, glistening metal that is lighter than iron but just as hard. As a result this full plate does not encumber more than a chain mail and is treated as a medium armor for purposes of movement and other limitations.

@1845 = ~In an effort to better protect their soldiers, the artificers of ancient Imaskar set about creating a kind of living symbiote, something that would bond with their user and protect them from harm. Using specimens pulled from the deepest pits of the ocean, the Imaskari spellcasters slowly began to graft these magically-enhanced creatures onto suits of plate mail, weaning them off of salt water and forcing them to rely on magic for nourishment. This technique worked well, allowing the user a far greater resistance to spells than normal... but other magewrights looked upon this creation with a growing fear, worried that a creature that fed on magic might soon grow too hungry and feed upon its masters instead. Because of this, only a few suits of this armor were ever made, and the creatures created by the Imaskari sealed away and forgotten.

The living symbiote feeds itself with low level spells and consumes them in the process, thus making the wearer completely immune to their effects. Unfortunately, it doesn't distinguish between harmful and friendly magic, but at least doesn't seem to interfere with spells cast by the wearer.

Even when defeat was certain and all others allied troops ran amok in chaos, the small group of deadpan knights continued to follow their commander's orders and fought until the sun set. Most of them died but their devotion to duty allowed the flying troops to reorganize themselves and when reinforcements finally arrived, the orc army was crushed.

Arngor of the Oak led the armies of men and elves and it is said that he dueled with the orc commander till the sun set and the land was bathed in a bloody mist. Finally the orc fell but Arngor had sustained wounds too vast for any to save him. His blood soaked through the armor he wore, infusing it with his courage and nobility. Thus the Armor of the Hart became known to men.

In many cases, the creator of the golem would send his or her creations after Debian for his snooping. Debian usually escaped without much personal harm. Unfortunately for Debian, his luck ran out when he investigated the lair of the Machinery Man, a bizarre lich who happened to be the creator of golems and other animated constructs.

Shields like this are first mentioned in ancient liturgies of Amaunator, in which the god's champions bear radiant shields against an infestation of undead. The shields made their first appearance in modern times in dramatic fashion, appearing miraculously at the altars of several of the deity's temples in the Year of Smoldering Spells, 1020 DR. Since that time a number have been lost in battle, and not a few were stolen by foul creatures to prevent their use.

Once a holy artifact used by the elite sect of clerics and holy warriors called Sunmasters, part of the enchantments fled with their god's demise, but it still remain a powerful tool for any adventurer.

@1985 = ~The dwarven clan of Clangeddin were famous for their work in darksteel, a material not to be found anywhere but within the Clangeddin clan homes within the Marching Mountains. In their efforts to find more and more darksteel, the Clangeddin delved ever deeper into the bowels of the earth.

It was on one such expedition that the seven sons of Argeld Heavyhand, the Clangeddin leader, were lost. The only survivor from the ill-fated expedition was Glimred Heavyhand, youngest son of Argeld. The lad returned with tales of drow and illithid and other darker, nameless horrors the like of which had never before been seen.

Desperate as he was to avenge his sons, Argeld could not send more of his people down into the depths of the mountain to face such horrors. Glimred himself, however, could not be dissuaded. To aid Glimred in his quest for vengeance, the dwarven smiths set about constructing the Darksteel Shield, a heavily enchanted shield that provides more protection than most suits of armor.

But Glimred was impatient, his lust for vengeance could not be deferred, and he disappeared into the bowels of the Marching Mountains before the work was completed, never to be seen again. The disappearance and presumed death of his sole surviving son proved too much for Argeld, who died from the grief of a broken heart.

With their leader dead and their hero Glimred gone, the dwarves knew it was only a matter of time before their clan was overrun by their Underdark enemies. Before dispersing across the face of Faerûn, the clan sold the shield to the highest bidder - though the dwarven smiths to this day have refused to divulge the mysterious buyer's identity.

@2000 = ~Pergad the Red-Handed was a famous barbarian warrior near Silverymoon in the 11th century, Dale Reckoning. His tribe's battles against hordes of orcs, goblins, and hill giants are legendary throughout the north. Unfortunately for Pergad, the other tribes of the region decided to move south or settle in the cities of the north rather than fight against the seemingly endless waves of foes. Pergad's tribe, the Tribe of Dead Trees, was the last to make a stand. Though Pergad emerged victorious in a series of difficult battles, his tribe dwindled as quickly as the horde grew. At the Battle of Surbrin Shallows in 1014 DR, Pergad's tribe finally came to its end under cruel ogre clubs and giant-hurled rocks. Legend states that when Pergad finally realized that his tribe was doomed, he drove his trusted spear into the Surbrin riverbed, cursing all the goblins who crossed over the water that his people once thrived on. Orcish shamans claim that the spot where his spear penetrated the rock bled for days. A year later, two tribes of goblins were wiped out by a plague that spread among them after they settled in the Surbrin river valley. The spear subsequently disappeared in the river's currents, and was supposedly dragged into the open sea.

The Impaler has a palpable aura of magic that hints at the nature of the weapon and why it has been the bane of several powerful orc chieftains in the past. As one would guess, when a victim is struck, they are very nearly impaled as the massive enchantment does its dirty work.

Druids cleansed the area with fire, but some of the wood was taken by a local mage and made into this spear.

@2006 = ~Shortly after the Time of Troubles began the nomadic bandit tribes of the Calimshan desert were united under a single leader; a cruel and brutal giant of a man, the warlord Ixil Xaxsha. From their outposts in the forbidding desert waste, the nomads raided merchant caravans and terrorized travelers who dared journey over the road from Calimport to Myratma.

Rumors and legends quickly spread about the invincible Ixil, who rode at the head of every raiding party brandishing his infamous magical spear. Some believe he was not truly a man, but a demon in human form, drawn to Faerûn by the chaos and confusion of the Time of Troubles.

Ixil's own sadism and savagery did little to quell these allegations. During battle the head of Ixil's Spike, his mighty spear, would detach to pin opponents to the ground even as a new head magically reformed on the end of the spear. Often in the thick of combat, Ixil would pause to savor the helpless struggles of an enemy impaled by the point of his spear, seeming to delight in the writhing agony of his enemy.

The warlord was finally defeated when he was lured into attacking a contingent of powerful priests and knights from the Order of the Radiant Heart, posing as simple pilgrims. Witnesses to the battle claim Ixil was not slain, but was in fact banished to some hellish outer plane by the holy magic of the Order.

Though Ixil's body was never found, Ixil's Spike, his fearsome spear and the symbol of his power, was recovered. In an effort to utterly destroy the artifact, it was shattered into several pieces, which were scattered about the Southlands. For many generations this magical shaft has been separated from Ixil's Spike, the enchanted head of the legendary spear. However, even incomplete, this artifact is still a weapon of great power.

@2033 = ~Known only as the "Wild Man of the Wood," the man that carried this staff was a legendary figure near Trademeet until the day he died and returned to the soil. Those who saw him remember his dark, bark-like skin, and his wounds closing as soon as they were inflicted. He would harass irresponsible loggers and poachers, and old-timers tell of mercenaries chasing him with a dozen hunting dogs or more. The animals seemed ready to rip the poor druid to pieces, but he quickly turned them on their former masters. Rushing forward in hopes of a quick victory, the men-at-arms saw the final power of the staff, and as the vegetation trembled with the "Wild Man's" magical calling, there formed a green, rotting mix of life and death that shambled overtop of the terrified soldiers, killing them all.

@2065 = ~Blades of this type were long used by Sharran priests during the sacrificial rites of "Feast of the Moon" ceremonies. Legends say that, when she passed on, the remains of this sword's wielder were mummified, and the blade was placed within her chest as a symbol of power. In the first stage of a long forgotten ritual, she was to have been exhumed in a season, born again in some new form. Unfortunately, cult wars killed the few who knew of her existence; her tomb became a prison where she was forgotten, and there she developed a rage that bordered on insanity. Her grave was eventually found, but it was deserted and gave no indication of her whereabouts. Some venture to say that her anger was so concentrated, she became one with the very blade of her weapon. Regardless, after hundreds of years surrounded by constant hate, the sword harvested a power of its own. It is now exceedingly deadly in combat.

Disfigured as a child, Dramnek Olk was ostracized and ridiculed by his peers. In his loneliness, he spent many hours alone on the hills overlooking Trademeet. There Galloma, a wizard living in the area, discovered the youth and found in him a kindred soul. The two fast became friends, and more: they were master and apprentice. Galloma died before Dramnek's apprenticeship could be completed, however, and the youth found himself once more alone in the world. Eventually he made his way to the streets of Athkatla. There he became a cutpurse, augmenting his thieving skills with the little magic he'd learned from Galloma. Eventually he crafted this sword, which enhanced his weak body.

This ancient bronze sword is set with six matching bloodstones, and gains its name from its illusionary powers, which are very useful in combat.

Ilbratha was created by unknown hands at the behest of Azoun the First, long dead king of Cormyr. He bore it once into battle, at Ithmong in his war with Tethyr, and then lost it in a storm that wrecked his ship on the rocks of The Neck. All trace of it was lost until, 200 winters later, the sage Thallastam of Procampur was offered the blade for 1,500 gold pieces by a peddler from a nearby town who seemed ignorant of its true nature. Thallastam brought the blade to Elminster in Shadowdale, the only loremaster with an interest in swords whom he trusted. Elminster identified the blade from the writings of Azoun I (the old king's great-grandson had just come to the throne), and Thallastam bore it back toward Procampur by way of Tilver's Gap and Essembra. But he was never seen again, and did not reach Procampur. His ruined diary, staff, and a skeleton were found some years later when the Pool of Yeven in Battledale was dragged, but the sword was never found.

@2090 = ~Arbane's Sword +2~
@2091 = ~Sword of Agility
The first of these swords were created by the elf wizard, Lord Arbane of Myth Drannor many centuries ago. His first was stolen, so he made a second with the aid of an apprentice, who sold the secret to two other wizard-swordsmiths. The form of manufacture is thought to be forgotten now -Elminster has heard of no one making one in the last 500 years- but there are over a dozen in existence. Some have even been created with sentience and further powers.

One of many created in the name of the mage who first discovered how to enchant a blade in this manner, this was the weapon of the outlaw Garno, and many a cleric died at its edge. Garno became disillusioned with the gods when his family was put to the torch by clerics of Loviatar, and spent his life seeking revenge. Despite his focussed hatred of the devout, it is thought that one of the gods of chaos had a hand in Garno's acquisition of this sword, delighting in the havoc that followed the young man.

In the simplest of terms, a short sword can be considered a dagger with a blade so long that it can no longer be called a dagger. The term 'short sword' does not exist in sword classifications. However, it has come to be used to describe a double-edged blade about two feet in length. The sword tip is usually pointed, ideal for thrusting. There are etched runes on the surface of this weapon that glow during combat, indicating it has undergone some form of enchantment, but no identifying marks can be found.

Before Ilban, however, Belm was in the possession of a holy slayer from distant Zakhara. According to sages, the light sword was crafted to serve an order of assassins. Belm's owners survived through many incredible ordeals, mostly because of the magic of the weapon. The weapon was lost in Calimshan when a holy slayer pursued a pasha's blasphemous agents to Calimport. The scimitar remained in the hands of Baris Cabal for about a dozen years before the band was broken up by Ilban and his companions. Ilban's exploits took Belm into battle against sandmen, giant scorpions, desert raiders, evil sorcerers and the demonic servants of Celan Harad.

@2105 = ~Adjatha the Drinker +2~
@2106 = ~The Drinker is first known to have existed more than 400 years ago, in the reign of Kurskos Ironhand; it was the sword of that monarch's herald and chief counselor, Amrok of the Dwarves. Kurskos slew Amrok in a night of revelry after a Shieldmeet, and took Adjatha the Drinker (and the enminity of the dwarves) as his own. Amrok was of almost human stature, and it has often been said Adjatha is of human and not dwarven manufacture, for it is of the full size and heft for a strong long-armed human swordsman.

The blade was stolen from the palace vaults in the sack of Aumreayum on the death of Kurskos, and since then The Drinker has changed hands often over the years, usually remaining with any one owner for only a short time. Elminster saw Adjatha 40 winters ago at the court of Nesker of Mulmaster, when the sorcerer-king was studying it to increase his own arts. It disappeared before Nesker's death and came to light briefly in reports of fighting in the Shaar, apparently being wielded by one of the nomad chieftains. The sword was stolen from him, and despite sending agents far afield, he was unable to recover it. Its whereabouts were unknown... but some suggested that the blade could have left the Prime Material Plane.

@2107 = ~Namarra +2~
@2108 = ~The Sword That Never Sleeps
On one side of the blade is etched in Common "Namarra", and on the other face "Never Sleep". Namarra appears in many legends and tall tales, but the designation the "Neversleep Sword" appears to be derived only from the inscription on the blade and does not refer to any specific property of the sword. Its origin is unknown; Namarra appears to have existed for long as tales have survived, wielded by such mythic heroes as Eth and Brensyl the Tall. Even the most critical of sages (Kurmur the Skeptic, First Speaker of Evernoster) cannot determine Namarra's probable time of origin or find any references in the tales of a word to a time "before Namarra was forged".

This ancient blade is thought to have been present at some of the most influential conflicts in Faerûn's history. Sightings have been noted as far north as Thay and as far south as the jungles of Chult, though documentation is oddly lacking regarding the details. This is perhaps a result of the sword's ability to silence all sound within a large radius, removing the effectiveness of attacking mages, but also preventing any discussion that might have followed.

@2137 = ~Celestial Fury +3~
@2138 = ~Many years ago, fierce tempests and fires ignited by lightning ravished the province administered by daimyo Hoshi Katahiroi. The daimyo's advisers, all respected shukenjas, soon divined that Nature was not to blame, but a powerful dragon of an unknown order. Some of the wise men suggested that the creature was an abomination; others believed that it was born of Primal Chaos before Kara-Tur was formed. All the advisers agreed to name it Celestial Fury.

Yet daimyo Hoshi did not want to categorize the scourge of his province; he wanted to destroy it. He commissioned the famed Chigatta (a reclusive artisan, master of mystic arts), to construct a weapon that might sunder the dragon's spirit as well as cleave its scaled body. Chigatta's labors resulted in the finest katana imaginable, dubbed Celestial Fury after the beast it was fashioned to destroy, and enchanted with the power of flight.

With this weapon, Hoshi sought his province's bane among the storm clouds. Shouts and roars resounded through the heavens for days, and forked fire lit up the nights. At long last, Hoshi destroyed the dragon's body and trapped its spirit within his sword, merging the two Celestial Furies and impressing order over chaos. To finalize his victory, Hoshi had Chigatta fashion a scabbard from the dragon's hide and embed its magic pearl in the hilt.

Yet the dragon had its revenge. Hoshi was skilled in battle but weak of will. Celestial Fury's spirit took control of Hoshi, forcing him to slay Chigatta and then slay himself. The katana subsequently disappeared (most likely, Hoshi's grieving family discarded the traitorous weapon) and has perhaps changed many hands in the years since.

@2139 = ~Water's Edge +3~
@2140 = ~Due to their religious responsibilities, minions of Umberlee, are supposed to avoid personal entanglements with those who work the sea. Of course, even among those who follow dark gods, the pursuit of pleasure and emotional gratification often cause them to stray from their commandments. One priestess who strayed in such a fashion was Kalana Fisher. In 1357, she began a romance with the pirate captain Balhoderie. Though both were extremely flawed people with outrageous personalities and a complete lack of faithfulness, they had a strange mutual affection for each other. But while Balhoderie's great flaw was his mean temper, Kalana's was in holding grudges.

In 1366, Kalana tracked down the murderer of Balhoderie, a Talosian pirate captain named Madion. She planted information in Madion's spy network and anonymously offered him a tantalizing prize: three high-value merchant ships leaving the port of Baldur's Gate with few defenses. Low on money, Madion took the bait. He was slaughtered by the numerous guards that poured from the ships' holds.

As it had turned out, the merchant captain was a superstitious sort and had gone to the temple of Umberlee in Baldur's Gate for a divination. Without hesitation, the priestess Kalana had foretold a horrible attack outside the port. Not only did Kalana get her revenge, but the captain became a lifelong donator to the church of the Bitch Queen.

Nobody knows if Water's Edge, the blade Kalane had crafted for Balhoderie, was somehow retreived by the priestess herself or got lost in the ocean.

The further the orientation of a target from true balance, the more potent the damage they suffer.

@2148 = ~Godsbane Legacy
This blade is highly prized by those who serve the Shadowlord, as well as any who engage in shadowy business.

Godsbane was the sword form assumed by Mask during the Time of Troubles. He would eventually come to be wielded by the then-mortal Cyric, who acquired the sword by murdering a halfling named Sneakabout, who in turn killed the former wielder of the sword.

Cyric named the sword "Godsbane" because while he was a mortal, he used it to slay Bhaal (then Lord of Murder), and after becoming a deity, he used it to kill Leira, Lady of Deception.

The soon-to-become Prince of Lies also used it to kill Kelemvor Lyonsbane while atop Blackstaff Tower, but to spite Cyric for trying to break his will while he was a mortal, Mask as Godsbane hid Kelemvor's soul from him. During a revolt in the City of Strife that marked the end of Cyric's reign as Lord of the Dead, Cyric learned of this and snapped the blade in two. This revealed the sword to be an aspect of Mask, the god of thievery and intrigue. By doing this, Cyric greatly weakened Mask and gained the portfolio of intrigue, along with shadowy characteristics. For this, Mask hates Cyric, and he continuously plots ways to recover his lost portfolio.

Whether this blade is one of the original sword's reproductions, or another of Mask's attempts to seek his revenge is beyond anyone's knowledge.

There was a time before Neverwinter was warm and before the great Anauroch was dry... or so it is said. Few relics remain to prove such an age existed, and fewer still have an identifiable purpose. "The Burning Earth" seems straightforward enough - it burns a victim with magical fire, and a cryptic rune seems to suggest that the power comes from the ground itself - but whoever constructed it remains a mystery. It looks a perfectly serviceable weapon, but something in the balance or grip is... wrong. It strains the forearm a touch, and does not fit the hand just right. It shouldn't hurt a warrior's performance, aside from the nagging suspicion that the blade was not made for him... or any other humanoid.

There are those who believe soul stealing capability has cursed the blade, for though fashioned as a weapon of right and justice, Foebane's dark history is one of murder and death.

In the aftermath of Demron's murder, Foebane was recovered and presented to the hero Fflar to use in the defense of Myth Drannor, greatest of the Elven cities.

Yet even the power of Foebane was not enough to withstand the dark hordes which overran Myth Drannor. When the elven city fell, Captain Fflar met a grisly, gruesome end and the sword itself was lost beneath the rubble of the once great metropolis.

@2205 = ~Lilarcor +3~
@2206 = ~Lawrence Lilarcor was well known, not for being brave, but as an idiot. As the tale goes, the boastful Lilarcor left his village at the urging of his friends so that the "great hero" could do battle with a devious Treant. He walked for days in the dead of winter until, feverish, he found his target and began an epic wrestling match. Unfortunately (or perhaps luckily), the "Treant" was nothing more than a craggy old normal oak. His friends had been jesting, not actually expecting that Lilarcor would go fight the fictitiously dangerous tree. That might have been the end of it, but Lilarcor, not really knowing what a Treant was in the first, didn't realize the truth. He eventually uprooted the oak and, marching proudly home, he declared himself a hero. Thus was born a laughing stock of epic proportions, and over time the name of Lilarcor became the sacrificial fool in many tales of "less than brilliance".

It is not known whether this enchanted weapon is Lilarcor himself, perhaps imprisoned by an evil mage or some other odd coincidence of fate, but it certainly acts in a manner consistent with his level of competence. If it is he, he has never bemoaned his captivity. He might not realize, or care, that he is no longer a human.

As a weapon, Lilarcor has its uses, but many a warrior has eventually given it away. Banter such as "Ouch, that musta hurt", "Oh yeah! Got 'im good," and "Beware my bite for it might... might... might really hurt or something," is a constant barrage on a warrior's psyche.

On the githzerai's home plane of Limbo, solid matter is something of a rarity. Limbo itself is a soupy mass of elements, and only through force of will can the githzerai shape these elements into stable matter.

A substance called "karach" is a material that can be shaped with the mind. Dak'kon's blade is composed of this substance and through mental discipline alone, the wielder must maintain the integrity of the blade. He can shape it slightly depending on his skill, adjusting its length, sharpness of the edge and to a lesser extent, its magical properties.

Those who possess it inevitably become creatures of the night themselves, operating as easily in the dark as they would during the day - and under the watchful eye of Shar.

@2228 = ~Balduran, a legendary seafaring explorer, was the first native of Faerûn to set foot on the lands known as Anchorome, making the trek up to Sossal. He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail for Anchorome once more, not to been seen again to this day. His money was well-spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

This plate was worn by the famous hero Balduran. It is part of a set of weapons and armor that was stolen from the museum in the city of Baldur's Gate. No one really knows what fate befell Balduran, the founder of Baldur's Gate, but people never grow tired of speculating. When his personal armor was found on the Sword Coast - supposedly recovered and sold by a group of adventurers - it only served to spark interest in him once again, and several copies of the suit were made to accommodate collectors and historians. In this way, it could be said, Balduran obtained a measure of immortality.

This shield looks and works like a normal shield, but instead of a coat-of-arms, the front is mirror-reflective, and the inside is crystal clear.

This flail was created a century ago to commemorate the defeat of the demon Belhifet. It was meant to remain within the town of Easthaven to remind the people of the great evil that had barely been defeated, but it was stolen, only to reappear years later on the northernmost reaches of the Sword Coast, in the City of Sails.

For a brief but bloody time, the fighting pits of Luskan were home to a particularly vicious halfling who called herself "Flurry." Though her opponents were swift to underestimate her, they were quickly surprised by the speed of her attacks and the effectiveness of her strikes. As her reputation grew, Flurry grew reckless, allowing her opponents one free hit on her small frame - showing off to the crowd that she seemed to be unharmed by the blow - before viciously bludgeoning her opponent to death. In the end, it was Flurry's own ego that did her in: in a match where her speed and cunning could have bested her adversary easily, the free hit she allowed him with his scythe proved to be more effective than she had planned, and send her head tumbling into the dust.

The Red Wizards themselves demanded ownership of the weapon after that, fearing what might have become had Zarine taken the weapon with her... or had attempted to free more slaves with it as well.

He returned full of tales and vast wealth, and put forth a large sum of money to protect his sparsely-settled home harbor town. Then he set sail of Anchorome again and has never been seen again. His money was well-spent on the wall though, and that small town soon grew into the city of Baldur's Gate.

This ornate but poorly balanced weapon was found within the wreck of Balduran's ship. Gold weapons are not known to be useful in combat, but legends say that only weapons forged of gold can harm such dread creatures as the loup garou.

Though many bugbears were killed, the gnomes were eventually caught and the village destroyed.

The blade is indeed vampiric, as the name would suggest; but not only in the manner the finder might have hoped. This semi-sentient blade performs as one might think a vampiric blade would, but it was crafted by vampires for their exclusive use, and any living being wielding it will slowly bleed to death in order to feed its unending thirst for blood.

The keen blade shatters through any opponents's defenses and, as if of its own volition, it will swoop down and deflect the incoming attacks of other weapons. This blade is perfect for the warrior concerned about defense as well as offense but it is so sharp and light that it is difficult for even a master to wield. Viromoto gradually became overconfident, and for his final duel, he favored a different weapon - only to fall in battle, his first and only defeat.

Untransformed, the rod may serve as a powerful club with defensive enchantments, but its true power lies in the seven studlike buttons along its length that unlock the rod's magic. The first four of these buttons extend and transform the rod into alternative forms: a flail of disruption, a flaming long sword, a hypnotic axe, and a spear of speed. The final three buttons, rather than transforming the rod itself, instead activate powerful abilities: the first creates a ghastly spectre of the wielder, terrifying all those who see it; the second completely paralyzes another creature, rendering them helpess when pointed at; and lastly, the third directly sucks at the life of the target, healing the wielder of the rod.

On the Moonshaes, however, this aspect has a specific purpose: the disruption of the Balance.

Little is known about this item, other than that the claw itself was taken from the corpse of the great beast.

Its power was greater than he had hoped, and he later turned to petty burglary using 'his' music to captivate his victims. Greagan ultimately disappeared some years ago amidst rumors of a bardic college uncharacteristically moved to violence. The harp still functions, though any self-respecting troubadour would reserve its use for the most dire of circumstances.

Gargantua was self-proclaimed lord of his immeasurable lower regions until his son, Pantagruel, questioned the accuracy of the ruler. With his shortcomings exposed, great Gargantua lay prostrate upon the ground while Pantagruel sought to cover his cuirass in case his now governing body lost its sway. He was warned that the people would cut him no slacks, but he never listened, and had burned his britches behind him. Undaunted, he fulfilled his animus with the robes of his father, as uncomfortable as that might sound, and shaped the Metal "Unit" with his own hands.

The rule of Pantagruel was a discommoding morass, his armor eventually suffering a breach in the breech that proved his undoing. As his basket left the pantry, so to speak, his regime fell to insurrection, and so complete was the sacking that not even his Metal "Unit" could be found. The component pieces, a pantaloon triumvirate, were lost in the annals of time.

You now bear the awesome responsibility of the Metal "Unit". Gussets of wind, seams like reality, pockets of resistance, the seat of power, and legs as flared as your temper. Polish it well; the onus is now on you.

It was in this year that a group of orc bandits allegedly kidnapped and killed a Tethyrian noblewoman, and the response from authorities was a genocidal slaughter of orcs throughout the south in her memory. Krotan mounted a defense that ensured his people were not entirely destroyed, though they were displaced. Krotan himself fell near the end of the conflict, and his head was mounted outside the graveyard where the young lady was buried. As a point of interest, orc's called this time the "Year of Pushing Too Far."

Though a skilled weaponsmith, his true gift was his ability to whistle a heartfelt song that could cause a grown man to cry like a newborn. Only a reclusive mage shared and enjoyed time with the diminutive man, however, as others could only see his small size as a source of amusement. Deaf to the smith's song because of their own prejudices, their ridicule slowly grew into cruel torment which eventually persuaded the light-hearted man to leave his home forever. Before he left, he forged this weapon as a gift for his one friend, who also enchanted it during the making. Thus the blade sweetly whistles to its wielder when unsheathed. It was not long after that the mage also deserted the small town in disgust, taking the sword with him on his journeys.

"Oh, shocked from the strike of his powerful bow,
The slain game sought by Adaniss falls.
Long ago in the time of the Quiet Earth,
The hunt from the famed High Forest calls.

The Duke of Everlund known for his boast 
Of the trophies held in his pride as dear. 
Intensely enraged at his rival hunter
Whose bounty by far surpassed his one year. 

One morn tragedy befell the land
With the misconceived death of the Duke's prized hound.
Fallen at the base of a great elm tree 
A bow's shot death in its heart was found. 

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The same eve Adaniss called on the Duke,
His solemn mistake he wished to repay.
But the noble's rage claimed ten pounds of flesh
And an archer's arm hit the ground that day.

The evil lord demanded justice unjust
The most vile curse on his arm to be cast.
Vengeance he sought for the price he had paid
Rhyte vowed the hound's arrow not to be his last.

In sorrow the town helped him forge an axe
Blessed to honor his most glorious day.
With the mark of Rhyte's arrow to guide its strike
And reputed to kill in the very same way.

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

Again called the forest with its precious game,
And a prize Adaniss with thrill did he seek. 
But none could be finer than the great clawed falcon 
Sought by all amidst the forest's Lost Peaks.

Once more the rivalry of the Duke did stir,
For he thought of his skills with Rhyte's bow to be best.
And set his sights on the glorious bird 
To emerge as the holder of its sainted crest.

The two climbed the peaks and searched days on end,
Each of their wills set as strong as the stone.
They found each other at a cliff by chance;
Both of their hatreds ran as deep as the bone.

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte.

The Duke drew the bow and pulled the string taut,
But first flew Adaniss's axe with its blow.
Cleaved, the lord stumbled to cliff's edge and off,
Defeated by Rhyte's last arrow...

With skill so great targets in his eyes were at the mercy of his arrow's flight.
His hands sure and still,
Never missing a kill,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte,
None could match the marksmanship of Adaniss Rhyte."

The "shamshir," as it was originally called, is larger, has a greater curve to it, and is tapered to an elongated, sharp point. Thus, it is slightly slower, but tends to be more effective and deadly in combat. This scimitar is particularly good at its job, as it has been enchanted with a few magical properties.
