  <strong>Item Revisions V4 b10</strong><br />
  <strong>IR Revised V1.3.500</strong><br />
  <strong>Languages:</strong> English<br />
  <strong>Platforms:</strong> Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Item Revisions aims to enhance all items in Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II. Particularly weak items have been made more effective, overpowered items have sometimes been toned down, and many item descriptions have been extended or replaced with more interesting descriptions. Item Revisions additionally includes a number of rule changes that may be installed individually, according to your preferences.</p>
</div>

<h2>Important Notes</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  If bugs are discovered in the current version of the mod, they are usually corrected in the latest github repository. Before installing IRR, check <a href="https://github.com/BartyMae/IR_Revised">here</a> and download the latest version via the green "Code" button and then "Download ZIP".
  </p>
  <p>
  To install this, you must extract the latest official version of IR (V4 b10, or have an automated tool do it for you) to your game directory as per normal, and then additionally extract this mod on top of it before installing IR. Specifically, IR's item_rev folder should overwrite the normal item_rev folder - confirm to overwrite folders as well as all files it asks you to. Make sure to look at your settings.ini in your item_rev directory! There are a number of different customization options in there that you will likely be interested in and possibly want to change in order to get the most out of this mod.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  This mod has been designed to work with original <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal">BG2:ToB</acronym> installations. It has not been extensively tested solely with <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn">BG2:SoA</acronym>, but there are no problems anticipated if the expansion is not installed. The mod has also been tested and should be completely compatible with BGT, Tutu, and Enhanced Edition games. A proper install order, such as listed below, should be followed to attain maximum compatibility between different mods.
  </p>
  <p>
  The main component of <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> overwrites existing items and their descriptions, so it should be installed before mods that patch items. If you would prefer certain items remain unaltered by <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>, you have the option to disable specific item modifications prior to installing the mod. You can find instructions on how to do this in the Power Users section below. The other components of <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> have been designed to patch all items, including items added by other mods, so they should be installed after all mods that add or replace items. Ideally, these components should be installed just after other tweak mods (near the very end of the install).
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Install Order</strong><br />
  Item Revisions has been designed with Spell Revisions, Sword Coast Stratagems, and 1pp in mind. 1pp is a mod by Erephine that was fully integrated into the Enhanced Editions (and thus EE users do not need to install it) that fix numerous visual inconsistencies, improve bad graphics, tweak and add new graphics, etc. for BG2:ToB games - if you are not playing an Enhanced Edition game, it is highly recommended that you install 1pp to take full advantage of its changes. The general install order is to first install everything you want of 1pp except for the avatar-switching component, then the main component of IR/R, and finally the main component of SR/R. The avatar/armor-switching script of 1pp (or Anthology Tweaks) should not be installed until later in the install after all item-adding mods, including IR, have already been installed - after SCS/atweaks/Infinity Animations is my suggestion). Once again, Enhanced Edition players do not need to worry about 1pp - it's already integrated into your game and doesn't need installation.
  <br /><br />
  Your general install order (excluding ToBEx/BG2 Fixpack/1pp/BGT if you're playing an Enhanced Edition game) should look something like this:
  <ul>
  1. ToBEx<br />
  2. BG2 Fixpack<br />
  3. Baldur's Gate Trilogy<br />
  4. Ascension<br />
  5. BG1UB (and other BG1 content mods)<br />
  6. Unfinished Business<br />
  7. Quest Pack (and other BG2 content mods)<br />
  8. Rogue Rebalancing<br />
  9. 1pp (EXCEPT for the "Smart Avatar & Armour Switching" component)<br />
  10. Item Revisions (main component)<br />
  11. Spell Revisions (main component)<br />
  12. Infinity Animations (main component)<br />
  13. Anthology Tweaks<br />
  14. Spell Revisions (secondary components - key here is to be before SCS)<br />
  15. Sword Coast Stratagems<br />
  16. atweaks<br />
  17. polytweak<br />
  18. Item Revisions (secondary components)<br />
  19. Infinity Animations (secondary components)<br />
  20. 1pp/Anthology Tweaks ("Smart Avatar & Armour Switching" component / "Avatar Morphing Script")
  </ul>
  You may not be using all of these, and will undoubtedly be using more besides that, but this should give you the general idea of what your install order should look like. Don't install the secondary components of IR/R and SR/R until much later in your install, after all item/spell/NPC-adding mods have been installed. For IR/R, post-SCS/atweaks is what is suggested - in contrast, the secondary components of SR/R should usually be installed right before SCS to make sure that SCS spellcasters are using the correct versions of spells. If you're using an automated tool to install your mods, the very least you should see is the general install order be 1pp-IR-SR.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>D0Tweak</strong>
  <br />
  The Visual Ioun Stones component from Ding0's Tweak Pack should not be installed with <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym>'s main component because <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> uses different ioun stone animations provided by WoRm.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Mods that Overwrite Item Descriptions</strong>
  <br />
  Older tweak mods overwrite item descriptions instead of dynamically patching them. Avoid these components to keep your descriptions accurate.
  <ul>
  Ashes of Embers: Sensible Weapon Restrictions<br />
  Ashes of Embers: Throwing Spears<br />
  Unfinished Business: Extended ToB Item Descriptions<br />
  </ul>
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  <strong>Windows</strong>
  <br />
  Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym> and is distributed as a self-extracting archive. To install, simply double-click the archive and follow the instructions on screen. Alternatively, the files can be extracted from the archive using <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/">WinRAR</a> or a similar program (e.g. WinZip, 7-Zip). If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder and setup-item_rev.exe in your game directory. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click setup-item_rev.exe and follow the instructions on screen.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please run <strong>setup-item_rev.exe</strong> in your game directory to reinstall, uninstall, or otherwise change components.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Mac OS X</strong>
  <br />
  <em>If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version.</em> Item Revisions is packaged and installed with <acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. If properly extracted, you should have an item_rev folder, setup-item_rev, and setup-item_rev.command in your <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> folder. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. To install, simply double-click <strong>setup-item_rev.command</strong> and follow the instructions on screen.
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Linux</strong>
  <br />
  Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify. Any hotfixes should be applied at this point. Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="http://www.weidu.org/~thebigg "><acronym title="Weimer Dialogue Utility">WeiDU</acronym>.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal and cd to your BG2 installation directory, run 'tolower' and answer Y to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lower cased file name. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.
  <br /><br />
  Run <strong>WeInstall item_rev</strong> in your game directory to install the mod. Then run <strong>wine BGMain.exe</strong> and start playing.
  </p>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>
  The changes made by Item Revisions fall into two categories - individual and global. The main component of the mod will install all of the individual changes, like adding new abilities and lore to existing items. The other components of the mod are designed to provide rule changes to all items in the game, including those added by other mods.
  </p>
  <h3>Main Component</h3>
  <p>
  <strong>Item Revisions by Demivrgvs</strong>
    <br />
	<em>Any modifications made to items prior to installing this component will be overwritten.</em>
    <br /><br />
	This component contains all of the changes made to specific items, and it also automatically includes the executable patch ToBEx (the engine modification is needed for several changes to function properly) for non-EE games. Listed below are some of the philosophical changes.
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Characteristics Set by Items</strong>
        <br />
		Items that previously set character attributes to X now increase the base value by Y. This change is aimed to remove some exploits (like having characters with 3 charisma suddenly becoming more charismatic than King Arthur just by equipping a standard magic item), and to make characters' starting attributes more important. Items that previously set characteristics to 18 or 19 will now grant +2 instead, 20 to 21 are now +3, 22 to 23 are +4, and 24 to 25 become +5.
		<br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Prices</strong>
        <br />
		I found the prices of items in vanilla <acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> to often be quite random, and I wanted to tie them to the actual value of the item. I've used the following table as a guideline to standardize item prices, adjusting it a little when needed.
        <br />
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th class="leftalign">Total Enhancement Bonus</th>
            <th>Price</th>
            <th>Notes</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">Base Item</td>
            <td>As Per <acronym title="Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons">AD&amp;D</acronym> 2nd Edition Player's Handbook</td>
            <td>&nbsp;
          </td></tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">Masterwork</td>
            <td>500gp</td>
            <td>Daggers: Half-Price</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+1</td>
            <td>1000gp</td>
            <td>Unenchanted Full Plate Is Treated as +1</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+2</td>
            <td>3000gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+3</td>
            <td>5000gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+4</td>
            <td>7500gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="leftalign">+5</td>
            <td>10000gp</td>
            <td>&nbsp;</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <ul>
          Sensible prices combined with Store Revisions will make money a real issue. Think twice before buying every cool thing you see.
          <br />
        </ul>
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Sensible Lore System</strong>
        <br />
		In my opinion, the lore system in the vanilla game was broken, having random lore values and allowing a level 10 bard to identify just about everything. I've changed both the lore table and the required lore to identify every item. The effect of intelligence and wisdom on lore is unchanged.
        <br /><br />
        <ul>
          Class Lore Tables: Fighters/Paladins/Rangers (+1 lore/level), Clerics/Druids (+2 lore/level), Thieves/Blades (+3 lore/level), Mages (+4 lore/level), Bards (+6 lore/level).
		  <br /><br />
          Lore to Identify: Every item will require 10 lore per enchantment bonus, plus an additional 5, 10, or 15 depending on whether the item is common, rare, or unique. For example, Arrows +1 have a +1 bonus and are pretty common, so they require only 15 lore to be identified.
		  <br />
        </ul>
      <br />
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h3>Store Revisions</h3>
  <p>The structure of this component may be a subject to change in future versions, with possibility of splitting it into several components. Full documentation of changes is pending.
  <br /><br />Due to the nature of this component, it is conceptually incompatible with mods that add new items into vanilla stores. Nothing drastic will happen, though - you simply may discover that a merchant, who was supposed to sell scrolls, now also offers a sword, even if there is a blacksmith standing nearby.
  <br /><br />At the moment this component is only fully compatible with Spell Revisions (main component), aTweaks (Expanded Temple Services component) and Rogue Rebalancing (Additional equipment for Thieves and Bards component) if installed after them.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Store Revisions</strong>
    <br />Changes made by this component can be grouped into the following categories.
    <ul>
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Revised assortiment in stores</strong>
        <br />Each shop offers more unique selection of goods, than they generally did in vanilla BG2. Some also have their price mark-up changed.
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Re-allocation of lootable items</strong>
        <br />Some items, potions and scrolls are moved between crates, enemies and stores. Some powerful items have been sensibly removed from stores and are now effectively used by enemies, others have been moved to more appropriate locations based on their background. A number of ToB items are made available during the late stage of SoA.
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Re-ordering of items by their type in stores</strong>
        <br />Items will be ordered by their type and, to certain extent, enchantment level.
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Revised temple services</strong>
        <br />Temples will offer spells (and items in some cases) more suitable to their deities.
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>More scrolls with divine spells</strong>
	    <br />A wider selection of divine spells may be cast from scrolls.
      <br />
      <li class="spaced_item"><strong>Effect of Charisma and Reputation on Store Prices</strong>
	        <br />Reputation will no longer provide any discount (most stores shouldn't even know charname's reputation, and it doesn't make sense that neutral or evil parties are so heavily penalized). Charisma will still give a small discount.
	        <br /><br />
	        <ul>
	          
	            <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 15/16 (-5%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 17/18 (-10%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 19/20 (-15%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 21/22 (-20%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 23/24 (-25%), <acronym title="Charisma">CHR</acronym> 25 (-30%).
	          <br />
	        </ul>
      <br />
    </ul>
  </p>


  <h3>Global Changes </h3>
  <p>These components are designed to affect all items in game, and should be installed after other mods that add items.</p>

  <p><strong>Revised Armors</strong>
    <br />This component aims at making each armor type appealing in its own way: light armors allow high mobility while heavier armors offer higher protection in exchange for reduced mobility.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: This is one of the components that relies on a user-submitted list to categorize armors into their proper type. If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, or miscategorized, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a> and include whether you have installed the main <acronym title="Item Revisions">IR</acronym> component or not.</em>
  <ul>
  <p><strong>With Movement Speed Penalties</strong>
    <br />This option applies a reduction to movement speed, dexterity and speed factor while adding a small amount of damage resistance while wearing armor. The following table elaborates on the penalties and damage resistance.

  <p><strong>Without Movement Speed Penalties</strong>
    <br />This option applies all the above changes except the reduction to movement speed.
  </p>
  </ul>

    <p><strong>Revised Armor Bonuses</strong>
      <br />As of V4 this component is an integral part of the above Revised Armors. This component changes the hidden <acronym title="Armor Class">AC</acronym> bonuses vs different weapon types.

  <p><strong>Allow Spellcasting in Armor</strong>
    <br />Normally, wearing armor prevents casting arcane spells. These components enable arcane spellcasting while wearing armor, with some limitations. Bards ignore all limitations associated with spellcasting in leather, studded leather, hide, or chain mail armor.

    <ul><strong>With a Chance of Arcane Casting Failure</strong>
    <br />With this option, arcane spells cast while wearing armor have a chance to completely fail. The chance of failure depends on the type of armor worn.

  <p><strong>With Casting Speed Penalties for Arcane Casters</strong>
    <br />With this option, spells cast while wearing armor take longer to complete. The casting time penalty depends on the type of armor worn. Spells with longer casting times are easier for enemies to interrupt. A casting time of 10 is equivalent to a full round. Due to engine limitations, innate abilities and divine spells cast by arcane casters while wearing armor will also be affected by this change.</strong>

It does not enable backstabbing with weapons that single-class thieves cannot normally use - everything on the table at a -2 or worse modifier with the exception of quarterstaffs will remain unsuitable for backstabbing.

  <p><strong>Revised Critical Hit Aversion</strong>
    <br />This component will remove "immunity to critical hits" feature from all head slot items, making criticals something players should fear again (right now the whole party is immune to it because even Ioun Stones protect from them), and allowing the Main Component to use "immunity to critical hits" as a valuable special feature of selected items (e.g. a fortified armor). In exchange for losing the protection from critical hits, helmets will get 1 point of AC bonus. Circlets, ioun stones, and similar items won't get this AC bonus.
    <br /><br /><em>Note: If you find an item that appears unaffected by this change, please submit a report <a href="http://gibberlings3.net/forums/index.php?showforum=157">here</a>.</em>

    <p><strong>Items of Protection Can Be Worn with Magical Armor</strong>
      <br />This allows one to equip Necklaces, Rings, and Cloaks of Protection alongside magical armor, but it does not allow more than one item of Protection to be worn at the same time.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Remove Cleric Weapon Restrictions from Multi-Classed Clerics</strong>
      <br />Fighter/clerics with swords? Yes.
    </p>

    <p><strong>PnP Equipment for Druids</strong>
    <br />According to PnP, druids shun metal, but instead may wear equipment made from natural sources (namely scales of beasts). Items include armor, shields and headgear.

<h2>Shout Outs</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Demi:</strong> Firstly, many thanks to Gibberlings Three, especially Cam and cmorgan! Huge thanks of course to Westley Weimer, who created an astonishingly flexible and powerful mod editor for <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> games, and to the bigg for his modifications to that editor. Many thanks also to the creators of the Infinity Engine Structure Description Project, which clarified what the hell was going on several dozen times; and to Jon Hauglid, for Near Infinity. Special thanks to Erephine for creating and letting me use that wonderful <acronym title="One Pixel Productions">1PP</acronym> material! I'm also very grateful to anyone who has beta-tested the mod and/or provided much useful feedback.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Mike:</strong> I'd like to give a big thanks to the authors of the many tools we've used and to all the people who have contributed to the mod in one way or another. The mod community as a whole deserves special credit. The overwhelming majority of people who have an interest in the creation and playing of <acronym title="Infinity Engine">IE</acronym> mods are extremely supportive of one another, and knowing that your work will provide enjoyment to others is a great motivator. I'd also like to thank those individuals at <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> who set me along the path to modding in the first place and the <acronym title="The Gibberlings 3">G3</acronym> community for hosting this here. The <a href="http://www.gibberlings3.net/bg2tweaks/index.php"><acronym title="Baldur's Gate II">BG2</acronym> Tweak Pack</a> was a major inspiration and help while coding this mod, and some code has been directly pillaged from it. Finally, I want to thank Ardanis for picking up my slack while I was on modding hiatus.</p>
