install_item_reallocation       = 1 // moves around some items, matching SCS
ee_two_handed_shapeshifts       = 1 // for Enhanced Edition games, 1 means shapeshifts are two-handed (no off-hand attacks/shield), 0 means single-handed (potentially exploitable with dual-wielding and shields)
1pp_ee_helms_shields_colors     = 1 // 1 means magical helms and shields have forced colors but non-magical do not (default), 2 means both have forced colors, and 3 means neither do

// Miscellaneous
bracers_of_defense_mixed_ac     = 0 // more powerful AC bracers (5, 4, 3, Blinding Strike, and Bands of Focus) will have their flat AC setting reduced by 1, but then receive a +1 AC bonus that brings it back to the normal value and stacks with normal armor
nerf_edwins_amulet              = 0 // nerfs Edwin's Amulet to be just one additional spell slot per day instead of two; in exchange, both the BG1 and BG2 versions of this amulet receives a +3 bonus to saving throws vs. death
standard_saving_throws          = 0 // normal creature types added by IR (e.g. Valhalla berserkers) have vanilla-style saving throws instead of Spell Revisions' alternative saving throws
gorion_original_robes           = 0 // change Gorion's robes back to normal in BG1 (i.e. not the Robe of Acid Resistance which he'll drop when he's killed in the intro)

// Store Revisions
install_masterwork_weapons      = 0 // standard +1 weapons are changed to masterwork (outdated but mostly functional, recommendeded to use SCS component instead)
1pp_circlets                    = 0 // a handful of (revised) circlets from 1pp are added to BG2 stores (compatible with both 1pp and the EEs)

dnd_3e_scimitars                = 0 // sets scimitars' damage to 1D6 (from 1D8) and adds a +5% critical chance
dual_mode_wakizashis            = 0 // instead of 1D8 slashing (best light weapon in the game), wakizashis do 1D6 slashing-piercing (whichever is better against that specific enemy)
waki_ninja_animations           = 0 // wakizashis and ninja-tos use 1PP's original improved katana paperdoll that was unused; 1 means both types also use the short sword animation, while 2 means katana

// Revised Backstabbing
