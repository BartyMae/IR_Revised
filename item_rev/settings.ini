install_sensible_lore           = 1 // balances lore gains so classes other than bard have a better chance of identifying items
install_ioun_stone_animations   = 1 // new ioun stone animations by WoRm
install_item_reallocation       = 1 // moves around some items, matching SCS
1pp_ee_helms_shields_colors     = 1 // 1 means magical helms and shields have forced colors but non-magical do not (default), 2 means both have forced colors, and 3 means neither do
// 1pp_ee_bg1_style_shields     = 0 // 1 means BG1-style graphics become the standard for shields where available (NOTE: not currently fully implemented, do not use!)
ee_two_handed_shapeshifts       = 1 // for Enhanced Edition games, 1 means shapeshifts are two-handed (no off-hand attacks/shield), 0 means single-handed (potentially exploitable)

// Store Revisions
install_masterwork_weapons      = 0 // +1 weapons are changed to masterwork; outdated - mostly functional, but not recommended (use SCS component instead)

// Revised Armor
armor_dexterity_penalty         = 1 // adds dexterity penalties to armor
armor_speed_factor_penalty      = 1 // ditto for attack speed factor
armor_physical_resistance       = 1 // adds physical resistance bonus

armor_free_casting              = 0 // cheat version, will override other options and enable unrestricted spellcasting in armor (for either subcomponent)
bards_armor_spell_penalties	    = 0 // bards get the normal penalties to casting when using any armor lighter than chain mail

// Weapon Changes
halberds_can_slash_too          = 0 // 1 adds a slashing mode to halberds that you can switch to and from, 2 means halberds always do slashing-piercing (whichever is better)
flails_have_extended_range      = 0 // extends flails' range to 2
dnd_3e_scimitars                = 0 // sets scimitars' damage to 1D6 (from 1D8) and adds a +5% critical chance

waki_ninja_animations           = 0 // wakizashis and ninja-tos use 1PP's original improved katana paperdoll that was unused; 1 means both types also use the short sword animation, while 2 means katana
disable_xbow_reload             = 0 // crossbows have a forced pause mechanic after firing (1 sec for light xbows, 2 sec for heavy); when set to 1, this is disabled

// Revised Backstabbing
add_backstabbing_penalties 	    = 1 // gives backstab penalties to certain weapons, overridden by "Penalties with Thief-only Weapons" if chosen
